# 🧪 Task 3: Feature Extraction Thought Experiment

## 📖 Abstract

Feature extraction is a fundamental concept in machine learning that transforms raw data into meaningful representations to improve model performance.

---

## 🔍 Concept of Feature Extraction

Feature extraction identifies relevant characteristics from raw input data.

Examples:
- Image processing → edges, textures, shapes
- NLP → word frequency, embeddings
- Signal processing → frequency components
